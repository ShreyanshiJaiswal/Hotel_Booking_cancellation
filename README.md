# Hotel_Booking_cancellation
Analyzed hotel booking cancellations using Excel and Power Query with insights from guest behavior and reservation patterns.
üìå Project Overview
This project is based on a Kaggle dataset related to hotel bookings. The dataset contains information on two types of hotels: City Hotel and Resort Hotel. The goal of this project is to analyze booking cancellation patterns and understand what factors contribute to cancellations. Using Excel and Power Query Editor, the dataset is explored, transformed, and visualized to draw insights that can help improve hotel management strategies.

üß© Problem Statement
The dataset primarily focuses on booking cancellations. The aim is to identify:

How many cancellations are happening,

Through which channels and guest types cancellations are occurring,

During what time periods cancellations are more frequent,
so that hotel operations can be managed accordingly.

üéØ Objective
To explore the dataset and understand key contributors to booking cancellations.

To analyze cancellation patterns based on guest type, reservation status, hotel type, and time period.

To simplify and visualize the data for business understanding using Excel.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology and Tools Used
Microsoft Excel

Power Query Editor

üìä Data Description 
The original dataset consists of 119,390 total bookings, out of which 44,224 were cancellations. It includes approximately 36 columns, covering:

Booking details: hotel type, arrival date, stay duration

Guest details: adults, children, babies

Booking behavior: meal plan, market segment, deposit type

Booking changes, room types, special requests

Cancellation information: is_canceled

Contact and metadata: agent, company, name, email, phone number

New Columns Created:
Reservation Status: Labeled as Desired or Undesired based on comparison between reserved and assigned room types.

Guest Type: Derived from combinations of adults, children, and babies to categorize guests (e.g., Couple, Family, Single).

üîÑ Methodology
Loaded and explored the dataset in Excel.

Used Power Query Editor to:

Drop unnecessary columns

Handle null/blank values

Create calculated columns for Reservation Status and Guest Type

Filtered relevant columns for focused analysis

Created pivot tables and charts to analyze cancellations

Built a final dashboard in Excel to summarize findings

üìà Analysis Summary
Out of 119,390 bookings, 44,224 were cancellations, highlighting a significant portion of lost bookings.

A larger portion of cancellations occurred among couple-type guests, as they formed the majority of the overall guest count.

Most cancellations came from bookings where the reserved and assigned room types were the same, suggesting that room mismatch wasn't a major driver.

Cancellations were significantly higher during April, May, and June, indicating possible seasonal or operational influences.

City Hotels experienced a much higher volume of cancellations compared to Resort Hotels, reflecting behavioral or service-related differences.

üí° Insights & Conclusion
Couples represent a key segment driving cancellations and may require targeted communication or incentives.

Reservation mismatches don't appear to be a major factor in cancellations, but consistent room assignment is still important.

Specific months show higher cancellation rates, which can help in adjusting booking policies or promotional strategies during those periods.

The higher cancellation rate in City Hotels highlights the need to re-evaluate city-specific operations, customer experience, or pricing strategies.
